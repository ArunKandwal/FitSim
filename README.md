# 🧠 MemuSim – A Visual Memory Partitioning Simulator

**MemuSim** is a graphical simulator built in Python using Tkinter that visually demonstrates how memory partitioning works using **First Fit**, **Best Fit**, and **Worst Fit** allocation strategies.

It’s designed as an educational tool for operating systems students and enthusiasts to understand how memory blocks are allocated to processes dynamically.
